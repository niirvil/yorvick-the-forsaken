While he was not much of a social person he still had some friends at Dalaran,<br>some which he had kept in touch with even after moving to Darrowshire. But mostly he kept to himself enjoying the solitude of the forest and his cabin.<br><br>Yorvick had no family or children, nor did he ever had any intensions to start one, for work was his family.<br>When the plague broke out and and the Third War was raging on, Darrowshire became under attack and while the vanguard stood<br>hardily against the coming masses of scourge, the town fell quick and so did the vanguard.<br><br>One thing that Yorvick can remember before his death is when Captain Redpath was killed and his spirit torn apart by death knight<br>Marduk the Black who twisted Redpaths soul to spread the taint amongst the living, making Yorvick and other living beings attack<br>Darrowshire. Yorvick fell on the battle near the town, someone had cought him from behind with a sword.<br><br>Not much is known about faith of Yorvick other than that he was too now part of the scourge.<br>When the grasp of The Lich King faltered, Yorvick was able to break free of his former masters will and join the new force<br>formed by former Ranger-General Sylvanas Windrunner, he was now part of something called The Forsaken.</p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__inner"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Â© 2024 Powered by Publii CMS :: <a href="https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Theme</a> ported by the <a href="https://getpublii.com/customization-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Publii Team</a></p></div></div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://niirvil.github.io/yorvick-the-forsaken/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=c2232aa7558e9517946129d2a1b8c770"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
