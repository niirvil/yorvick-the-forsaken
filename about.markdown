Born in Eastweald that is now know Eastern Plaguelands, Yorvick was once living in small but cozy cabin near Darrowshire and was part of the vanguard that protected the town. 
He and the other four was appointed by the king Terenas Menethil II by himself to keep peace and safety at the surrounding areas and the town.
The vanguard consisted of five members that had experience in close quarters combat, magic and light, creating a formidable group of members that could work even in tough situations.

Before moving in Darrowshire, Yorvick was a mage that had been studying the arcane arts for years at Dalaran the city of mages. While he was not much of a social person he still had some friends at Dalaran,
some which he had kept in touch with even after moving to Darrowshire. But mostly he kept to himself enjoying the solitude of the forest and his cabin.

Yorvick had no family or children, nor did he ever had any intensions to start one, for work was his family.
When the plague broke out and and the Third War was raging on, Darrowshire became under attack and while the vanguard stood
hardily against the coming masses of scourge, the town fell quick and so did the vanguard.

One thing that Yorvick can remember before his death is when Captain Redpath was killed and his spirit torn apart by death knight 
Marduk the Black who twisted Redpaths soul to spread the taint amongst the living, making Yorvick and other living beings attack
Darrowshire. Yorvick fell on the battle near the town, someone had cought him from behind with a sword.

Not much is known about faith of Yorvick other than that he was too now part of the scourge.
When the grasp of The Lich King faltered, Yorvick was able to break free of his former masters will and join the new force
formed by former Ranger-General Sylvanas Windrunner, he was now part of something called The Forsaken.
